# TinyApp Project

Are you sick of sending your friends needlessly long URLs?

Wouldn't you rather have a link that doesn't take up your entire message box?

If this is you, TinyApp is here to meet your needs!

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (just like its distant relative, bit.ly).

## Final Product

!["A screenshot of all the user's created URLs](docs/urls-page.png)

!["A screenshot of a user's user-accesible-only edit page"](docs/edit-page.png)

## Features

- Stick any URL into TinyApp and you'll get a unique Tiny URL that goes to the same place!

- You'll be able to see all your created links on your 'My URLs' page.

- Anyone can use your Tiny URL link, but only you can edit or delete it!
