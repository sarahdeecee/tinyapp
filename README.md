# TinyApp Project

Are you sick of sending your friends needlessly long URLs?

Wouldn't you rather have a link that doesn't take up your entire message box?

If this is you, TinyApp is here to meet your needs!

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (just like its distant relative, bit.ly).

## Final Product

## Features
